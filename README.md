This repository contains Python scripts for various DNA and protein sequence operations, including generating complementary DNA sequences, identifying open reading frames (ORFs), translating DNA sequences to RNA and protein sequences, and converting protein sequences back to DNA sequences.

## Features

### DNASequenceTranslator
- **Complementary DNA Sequences**: Generates complementary DNA sequences from a given DNA sequence.
- **Translating DNA to RNA**: Converts DNA sequences to their corresponding RNA sequences.
- **Identifying ORFs**: Identifies open reading frames (ORFs) in DNA sequences.

### DNA to Protein
- **Read DNA sequences**: Reads DNA sequences from a specified FASTA file.
- **Convert DNA to RNA**: Converts DNA sequences to their corresponding RNA sequences.
- **Translate RNA to Protein**: Translates RNA sequences into protein sequences using a codon table.

### Protein to DNA
- **Read Protein sequences**: Reads protein sequences from a specified FASTA file.
- **Translate Protein to DNA**: Converts protein sequences into DNA sequences using a codon table.
